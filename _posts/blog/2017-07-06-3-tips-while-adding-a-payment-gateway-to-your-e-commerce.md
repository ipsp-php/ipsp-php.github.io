Any merchant, who does online selling and has an e-commerce or a business website, needs to have a good payment gateway seamlessly integrated into its business portal. While you may receive money through other channels like post-dated cheques among others, the process becomes lengthy, tiring and even insufficient, as modern tech-savvy customers like to pay through the most modern means of making cashless payments. These include credit cards, debit cards, net banking, cash cards and through other modes.

If you are not having a featured payment gateway integrated within your e-commerce, you are diverting the customer flow towards your competitor’s business website. Hence, you should start the process of getting a modern payment gateway today itself. 

For choosing the best amongst them, follow the below mentioned tips:

## Tip1: Choose on The Basis of Your Needs

The end results of payment gateway integration should well satisfy all your needs. While some payment gateways have a fixed monthly fee, others charge on the number of financial transaction your e-commerce does. You should choose the one that is affordable for you and by hiring which you do not waste money. You can also get a payment gateway even if you sell through brick-and-mortar stores, but in this case, you may be required to have two different merchant accounts.

If you sell internationally, your payment gateway must provide for the collection of payments that are made through international cards like Visa and MasterCard. If you have a broad domestic consumer base, your payment gateway should be able to collect payments through debit cards and net banking modes as well.

The best way is to opt for a payment gateway integration that provides for payment collections through numerous modes. A worthy payment gateway that offers you more than 100 payment collection options is better, as the customers today use numerous payment modes for making online payments.

## Tip 2: Research

The merchant account payment gateway will be a part of your online business website for a long period of time, and hence, you should spend some time selecting the right one. Payment gateways detail you all fee in an upfront manner and have a fully transparent operating mode. The gateway also has no hidden charges, which may shock you later. Others can have a number of hidden charges and would aim at drawing the most money out of your wallet. Hence, you should compare the fee structures of some major payment gateways operating in India and then choose wisely.

## Tip3: Look for Payment and Customer-Friendly Features

The best of payment gateway integration providers in India offer you a great set of features that contribute towards higher success rates of transactions and also provide for greater customer satisfaction. They offer you the “Smart Routing” and the “Auto-Retry” features that help you to have the highest payment success rates. The payment gateway should also provide you SSL security and should comply with the PCI: DSS standards.
