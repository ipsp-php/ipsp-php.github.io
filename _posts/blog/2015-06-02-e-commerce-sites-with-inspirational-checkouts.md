So you have an e-Commerce site or are building one, and you're wondering “What can I do to increase my conversion 
rates?” Well, then this post is for you! And while you're at it, you might want to read this one as well: How to Improve Your Conversions (Even if You Have None).

Here is a list of e-Commerce sites offering the most inspirational checkouts; the websites in this list have got their 
checkouts absolutely right and will give you a clear idea of how you can go about designing a checkout page that will 
increase conversions by turning visitors into customers:

<div style="clear:both"></div>

## 1. Apple

    <img src="https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Apple.png" alt="alt">

Apple has an attractive website that does full justice to the Apple brand. The checkout page is also very well-designed 
and makes good use of white-space to lay full emphasis on call to action buttons.

One of the most common reasons for basket abandonment is forcing users to register their details before they checkout. 
To get around this issue, Apple provides a guest check out option to its users which means shoppers are not required to 
enter a truckload of information into forms or create an account to purchase a product from Apple.

However, the flip side of a guest checkout option is the customer's shopping information won't be saved for future 
transactions, nor will they be able to track their order. But if that is not a problem with your customers, this is a 
helpful feature.

## 2. Bellroy

</figure>

Bellroy has handled the problem of shopping cart abandonment due to a lengthy checkout process differently as compared 
to Apple. It provides a one-step checkout to its users making the process completely smooth for its shoppers. Studies 
show that one page e-Commerce checkout pages have higher conversions as compared to a two page checkout.

On the Bellroy checkout page, users are required to provide just the most relevant information like delivery address 
and payment details. Designers have created the page in a manner such that all relevant details can be entered from a 
single page itself; this eliminates the need of having multiple webpages for checkout.

E-Commerce stores can design their checkout pages this way to avoid confusing shoppers and to save their time.

## 3. Nixon

    <img src="https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Nixon.png" alt="alt">
</figure>

There are e-Commerce stores that are not in favor of providing a guest checkout option or one-page checkout. Such 
e-Commerce stores that offer customers a multi-page check out process should take a cue from Nixon that has designed 
their checkout page brilliantly.

When customers are completing the checkout process, they want to have a clear idea of where they are and how many steps 
the page to inform shoppers about the number of steps involved in the process.

The website makes it easy for shoppers to make out the number of steps completed and the ones left by showing this 
information in ‘bold'.

The page also includes links to shipping policy, return policy, product warranty details and privacy notice to instill 
trust with the customers.

## 4. Amazon

<figure class="post-image post-image-center">
    <img src="https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Amazon.png" alt="alt">
</figure>

The common perception of web designers and e-Commerce store owners is to provide a bunch of options like 
‘continue shopping', ‘add to wishlist' or ‘buy later' on checkout page. Amazon altogether works on a different principle.

The checkout page on Amazon gives only two options to its users: either to purchase the products that are in their 
shopping cart or to simply close the window. This has been done to ensure that once shoppers are ready to buy a product,
 they are not distracted and their focus remains completely on that one task of completing the purchase journey.

## 5. Made

<figure class="post-image post-image-center">
    <img src="https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Made.png" alt="alt">
</figure>


Compared to other online furniture retailers' websites, Made is beautifully crafted. It features all its products in a 
manner that is visually stunning. Similar to product pages, the checkout page on this site is also clean and clear. 
Designers of this site have added the countdown timer on the page to create a sense of urgency in shoppers. 
This encourages them to make their purchases right then or risk missing out.

Apart from the timer, the page also displays how much shoppers are saving on their orders to make them more confident 
about their purchase decision and to entice them to click on the checkout button.

##  6. Toys”R”Us

<figure class="post-image post-image-center">

</figure>

There are times online shoppers are buying gifts for their loved ones. When purchasing from an online store, the item 
may ship in the manufacturer's original packing which may reveal what's inside spoiling the surprise.

Toys”R”Us can get a gold star for designing the novel feature which allows customers to keep gift shipments a surprise.

## 7. Fab

    <img src="https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Fab.png" alt="alt">
</figure>

Fab on its checkout page provides an option to login with Facebook to complete the purchase, thereby saving precious 
time of its customers which will otherwise be spent registering on the site.

Also, it shows shipping charges beneath each product in the cart. It offers free shipping for purchases that have gone 
beyond a predetermined amount and depending on the area the products are to be delivered. Free shipping is the factor 
that compels shoppers to order.

All e-Commerce stores cannot afford to offer free shipping as that can eat into their bottom line. But if that fits 
their budget, this is the option that should be considered to lure in customers.

## 8. eBags

<figure class="post-image post-image-center">
    <img src="https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/eBags.png" alt="alt">
</figure>

The checkout page of eBags is neatly laid out with informational content to provide all relevant information to 
shoppers on the page itself before they finally click on the ‘Continue Checkout' button.

On the checkout page, eBags has provided a live chat option that lets consumers get answers to their questions or 
doubts in real time. It also provides a loyalty program that awards customers with points in exchange of purchase. 
These points can then be redeemed in future by them.

## 9. Zappos

<figure class="post-image post-image-center">
    <img src="https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Zappos.png" alt="alt">
</figure>

The biggest concern of most online buyers is whether the site they are giving their personal information along with 
credit card details to, is safe or not. To quell these worries, Zappos provides its potential customers with trust 
signals like credit card logos, small lock icon and third-party security seals. The seals are prominently displayed on 
the checkout page to communicate security to buyers. This is an excellent shopping cart practice that every e-Commerce 
store should incorporate.

Moreover, it even lets users update quantity or remove from cart while they're still on the checkout page.

## 10. Dune London

<figure class="post-image post-image-center">
    <img src="https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Dune-London.png" alt="alt">
</figure>

Another essential for any e-Commerce checkout page is to make sure customers can always see exactly how much and what 
they are paying for. Dune London gets it right by providing the product summary on the checkout page. It even makes sure
 that customers know exactly how much they are paying as they go through the checkout process. This feature ensures customers they are not being saddled with any hidden charges.

The checkout page of Duke London delivers a clean and simple shopping experience to its users in an excellent manner.

## 11. Simply Hike

    <img src="https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Simply-Hike.png" alt="alt">
</figure>

This e-Commerce store's website is a great example of how an online retail store should keep customer needs at the back 
of its mind, while designing the site.

It offers different shipping options like ‘Standard', ‘Express' and ‘Next Working Day' and charges the customer accordingly.

Apart from shipping options, it also provides various payment options like credit card and Paypal to ensure customers 
don't abandon the shopping cart just because their preferred payment options are unavailable. This feature helps an 
e-Commerce store decrease shopping cart abandonment and increase conversions.

## 12. Crocs

<figure class="post-image post-image-center">
    <img src="https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Crocs.png" alt="alt">
</figure>

Croc's checkout pages are an exercise in design. Its ‘Move to Wishlist' feature lets shopper save the products for later.

They keep the buyer in funnel by recommending related products right at the end on the first checkout page. 
This is another excellent shopping cart practice which is quite under-used.

An e-Commerce store can boost conversion rates on their checkout page by providing all relevant information to 
their online potential customers, which helps them make a confident purchase decision. Take a cue from the aforementioned
 e-Commerce sites and optimize your checkout page for higher conversion rates!
