Paysafe Group, a leading global payments provider, will host its first global hackathon across five of its key developer locations: Sofia (Bulgaria), Vienna (Austria), Hyderabad (India), Montreal and Calgary (Canada); to identify new ideas, talent and innovation that align to its bold technology ambitions.

The global hackathon is open to all forward-thinking IT engineers with a passion for technology and coding who are looking for an opportunity to showcase their exceptional skills. Along with the opportunity to win large cash prizes, the successful hackers will have the opportunity to discuss rewarding career opportunities at Paysafe, a sought-after employer in payments with multiple employer awards and a Glassdoor rating of 4.2 globally.

Paysafe’s global hackathon will consist of two parts involving challenges focused on Graph Theory and Dynamic Programming:

1.	Online challenge from October 8th to October 20th:
The top three winners of the online challenge will receive a cash prize; 1st place wins $3,000, 2nd place wins $2,000 and 3rd place wins $1,000. The top 50 participants in each location will be contacted directly and invited to the on-site event.

2.	On-site events on October 27th:
The on-site events will take place at venues across the five countries.
Individuals will be required to present their work in front of a jury once everyone has completed the challenge. The location winner will be awarded a $5,000 prize and the overall global champion, who will be chosen from the five local winners, will win an additional grand prize of $20,000.

Commenting on Paysafe’s approach to developer talent, Paysafe’s Chief Product & Transformation Officer, Karim Ahmad said: “At Paysafe, we promote an entrepreneurial culture where we want to empower our team to develop technology which can revolutionise the way consumers pay around the world.
