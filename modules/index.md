# Modules

**IPSP PHP SDK** is compatible with the most used ecommerce CMS.
Install in a few clicks our modules for Prestashop, Magento or wooCommerce.

## Magento

The great thing about the **Magento Community Edition** release is that it has many features, 
many of which are not available on other open source platforms. For example, you can manage 
several stores, choose from different languages ​​and offer different currencies.

## PrestaShop

It's easy to install and configure the software, and everything is very intuitive. 
How much work you will create in the store with **PrestaShop** depends on you: you can download the fully 
placed or self-posted version so you can determine your own level of technical control (both are free).

## OpenCart

**OpenCart** is especially popular among small businesses that do not have anyone for employees with 
extensive programming experience. It's quite simple, without many other features found in other programs for shopping. 
This, of course, is a double-edged sword, since less complexity means that it is easier to use, 
but in the end you will not be able to get the same.

## WooCommerce (WordPress)  

In many ways, it is considered the leading e-commerce platform with open source for **WordPress**, **WooCommerce** 
has a large and rapidly growing user community. Its seamless integration with WordPress makes it easy to install 
and manage, which is one of the main reasons why retailers 
such as Cupcake Studio and EcoKitty have made it an open source e-commerce platform.

## Jigoshop (WordPress)

Another solution based on **WordPress**, which is gaining momentum, is **Jigoshop**. 
Like most other open source e-commerce solutions, Jigoshop is quite easy. For retailers who want to 
maximize their showcase, themes, plug-ins and extensions are available for purchase.

## Drupal Commerce

**Drupal Commerce** is one of the most popular open source e-commerce platforms among Drupal users. 
It has an easy-to-use administration system and is able to handle some of the more 
complex payment models, such as those based on subscription.
