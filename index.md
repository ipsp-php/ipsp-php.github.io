A payment service provider (PSP) offers shops online services for accepting electronic payments by 
a variety of payment methods including credit card, bank-based payments such as direct debit, bank 
transfer, and real-time bank transfer based on online banking. Typically, they use a software as a service 
model and form a single payment gateway for their clients (merchants) to multiple payment methods.
